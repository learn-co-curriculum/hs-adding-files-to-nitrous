# Adding Files to Nitrous

We've seen how we can add images to our websites that are hosted on the web already, but what if we want to add our own images? We can simply include them in our project directory and link to the files. You're all pros at navigating the command line, and luckily Nitrous makes it super simple for us to upload files. 

+ Click the Gear button in the file browser.
+ Click Upload Files
+ Drag/Drop the Images you want to include, or use the file browser to choose them.
+ Click Upload

That's it - now you can move the files to the location you want using the terminal!
